1. Installation.
----------------

The project was written using Python v. 2.7.3. There's no guarantee it'll work on any other version, although it doesn't use any advanced Python mechanics, so it should.

Create the folder in which you'll want to store your project, let's call it PROJECT_HOME. It has to be for this project only, as it will be bloated with files downloaded from the repository.
In this folder run "git init" to enable version control.
Run "git pull https://github.com/wojtasskorcz/priceo.git" to download the project files.

When the files have been downloaded create a virtualenv in PROJECT_HOME.
You'll need SetupTools for that so run *sudo easy_install -U SetupTools*.
